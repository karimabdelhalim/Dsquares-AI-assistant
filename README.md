## Dsquares Project Document Chatbot

To enhance employee interaction with project documents, we have developed an advanced chatbot designed to address the specific challenges faced by Dsquares employees in extracting and utilizing information from a large corpus of data. This chatbot leverages cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to provide precise and contextually relevant answers to employee queries.

By integrating LLM and RAG, the chatbot is capable of understanding complex questions and retrieving the most pertinent information from vast and diverse project documents. This solution aims to significantly reduce the time and effort required for employees to locate critical information, thereby improving efficiency, accuracy, and overall productivity.

The implementation of this chatbot will empower employees to make faster, more informed decisions, minimize the risk of errors, and enhance their ability to successfully execute projects. Ultimately, this innovative approach will contribute to achieving better project outcomes and driving the overall success of Dsquares.

1. **Data Preparation (A)**
    - The process begins with gathering and organizing raw data sources. This can include various formats like text documents, web pages, databases, etc.

2. **Information Extraction (B)**
    - Relevant information is extracted from the raw data sources using techniques like Optical Character Recognition (OCR), PDF data extraction, and web crawling.

3. **Chunking (C)**
    - The extracted information is divided into smaller, manageable chunks to improve efficiency and accuracy during the retrieval process.

4. **Embedding (D)**
    - Each chunk is converted into a numerical representation called an embedding. This allows for efficient similarity-based search within the vector database.

5. **Vector Database (E)**
    - The embeddings of the chunks are stored in a vector database, which enables fast retrieval of relevant information based on query similarity.

6. **Query Embedding (1)**
    - A user query is also converted into an embedding.

7. **Retrieval (2)**
    - The query embedding is compared to the embeddings in the vector database, and the most similar chunks are retrieved.

8. **Relevant Data (3)**
    - The retrieved chunks are presented as relevant data to the language model (LLM).

9. **LLM(s) (4)**
    - The LLM processes the retrieved data along with the original query to generate a comprehensive and informative response.

10. **Response (5)**
    - The final response is presented to the user.
